# Ziltoid and The Quest for Coffee

Mega Drive platformer based on the albums Ziltoid The Omniscient and Z^2^ - Dark Matters by Devin Townsend

Inspired by the Earthworm Jim games.

A very loose interpretation of the Ziltoid story, basically split in to three acts

1. Ziltoid's invasion of Earth for the Utimate cup of Coffee (By Your Command / Ziltoidia Attaxx / Solar Winds)
    ..+ Ziltoid invades the Earth
    ..+ Vs Captain Spectacular
2. Ziltoid vs The War Princess (War Princess samples)
    ..+ After discovering the ultimate coffee bean, it's stolen by Blataria and taken to Titan (War Princess samples)
    ..+ Ziltoid travels to Titan to defeat Blataria (feat. Deathray and March of The Poozers)
    ..+ Vs Blataria
3. Ziltoid confronts the Omnidimensional Creator and The Planet Smasher (Planet Smasher / Color Your World)
    ..+ Home of the Omnidimensional Creator
    ..+ Vs The Planet Smasher

Bonus Stages:
Like the "Vs Psycrow" levels from Earthworm Jim (Hyperdrive / N9 / Ziltoid Goes Home)
