# Ziltoid and The Quest for Coffee

Mega Drive platformer based on the albums Ziltoid The Omniscient and Z^2^ - Dark Matters by Devin Townsend

Inspired by the Earthworm Jim games.

A very loose interpretation of the Ziltoid story, basically split in to three acts

1. Ziltoid's invasion of Earth for the Utimate cup of Coffee (By Your Command / Ziltoidia Attaxx / Solar Winds)
    a. Ziltoid invades the Earth
    b. Vs Captain Spectacular
2. Ziltoid vs The War Princess (War Princess samples)
    a. After discovering the ultimate coffee bean, it's stolen by Blataria and taken to Titan (War Princess samples)
    b. Ziltoid travels to Titan to defeat Blataria (feat. Deathray and March of The Poozers)
    c. Vs Blataria
3. Ziltoid confronts the Omnidimensional Creator and The Planet Smasher (Planet Smasher / Color Your World)
    a. Home of the Omnidimensional Creator
    b. Vs The Planet Smasher

Bonus Stages:
Like the "Vs Psycrow" levels from Earthworm Jim (Hyperdrive / N9 / Ziltoid Goes Home)

End Credits (The Greys)
